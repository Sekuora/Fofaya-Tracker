Fofaya Tracker
This is my first application project in Python, a Time Tracker that monitors the time spent on different applications on a Windows machine. This project was developed with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool.

Project Description
The Time Tracker is a Python application that uses the PySide6.QtCore, psutil, win32process, win32gui, and pygetwindow libraries to track the active application on a Windows machine and record the time spent on each application.

The code is a bit messy and could be improved. I am considering working on that, but as the application already works as intended, I don't plan on making significant changes in the near future.

Installation
There are two ways to install the Time Tracker:

Installer: Download the installer from the releases section and follow the installation prompts.

ZIP File: Download the ZIP file from the releases section, extract the files, and run the main script.

Usage
After installation, run the application. It will start tracking the time spent on each application. The usage time for each application is saved every 10 seconds.

Contributions
As this is my first Python project, I welcome any suggestions or contributions to improve the code or add new features. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank GitHub Copilot for assisting me in this project. The AI-powered code completion tool was invaluable in helping me navigate the Python language and libraries.
